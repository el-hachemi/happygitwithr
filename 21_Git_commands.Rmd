*Unless you use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), most of the GitHub bits really have to be done from the browser.*   

New local git repo from a repo on GitHub:

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git
```

Check the remote was cloned successfully:   

```{bash}
git remote --verbose
```

Stage local changes, commit:  

```{bash}
git add foo.txt
git commit --message "A commit message"
```

Check on the state of the Git world:  

```{bash}
git status
git log
git log --oneline
```

Compare versions:  

```{bash}
git diff
```

Add a remote to existing local repo:  

```{bash}
git remote add origin https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r
git remote --verbose
git remote show origin
```

Push local master to GitHub master and have local master track master on GitHub:  

```{bash}
git push --set-upstream origin master
## shorter form
git push -u origin master
## you only need to set upstream tracking once!
```

Regular push:  

```{bash}
git push 
## the above usually implies (and certainly does in our tutorial)
git push origin master
## git push [remote-name] [branch-name]
```

Pull commits from GitHub:

```{bash}
git pull
```

Pull commits and donâ€™t let it put you in a merge conflict pickle:

```{bash}
git pull --ff-only
```

Fetch commits

```{bash}
git fetch
```

Switch to a branch

```{bash}
git checkout [branch-name]
```

Checking remote and branch tracking

```{bash}
git remote -v
git branch -vv
```
