We only consider a very constrained set of remotes here:

* The remote is on GitHub, e.g. its URL looks something like `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git` or `git@github.com:OWNER/REPO.git`.  
* The remote is named `origin` or `upstream`. These may not be the most evocative names in the world, but they are the most common choices.  

If you use a different host or different remote names, you should still be able to translate these examples to your setting.   

Along the way we note how these setups relate to the usethis package, i.e. how usethis can help you get into a favorable setup or how a favorable setup unlocks the full power of usethis. Many of these operations require that you have configured a GitHub personal access token. If you donâ€™t use usethis, feel free to ignore these asides. *2020-06 note: this currently refers to features in a development version of usethis. These features are not in v1.6.1 = the current CRAN version.*
