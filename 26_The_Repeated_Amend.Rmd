One of the principal joys of version control is the freedom to experiment without fear. If you make a mess of things, you can always go back to a happier version of your project. But you must have a good commit to fall back to!   

## 1 Rock climbing analogy

When I’m doing something tricky, I often proceed towards my goal in small increments, checking that everything still works along the way. Yes it works? Make a commit.  

The Repeated Amend is a pattern where, instead of cluttering your history with lots of tiny commits, you build up a “good” commit gradually, by amending.  

*Yes, there are other ways to do this, e.g. via squashing and interactive rebase, but I think amending is the best way to get started.*

## 2 Workflow sketch

### 2.1 Initial condition

Start with your project in a functional state:

* R package? Run your tests or `R CMD check`.  
* Data analysis? Re-run your script or re-render your .Rmd with the new chunk.  
* Website or book? Make sure the project still compiles.  
* You get the idea.  

Make sure your “working tree is clean” and you are synced up with your GitHub remote. git status should show something like:  

```{bash clean_and_synced, eval=FALSE}
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### 2.2 Get to work

Imagine we start at commit C, with previous commit B and, before that, A:  

```{bash , eval=FALSE}
... -- A -- B -- C
```

Make a small step towards your goal. Re-check that your project “works”.    

Stage those changes and make a commit with the message “WIP”, meaning “work in progress”.   

```{bash WIP_commit, eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "WIP"
```

The message can be anything, but “WIP” is a common convention. If you use it, whenever you return to a project where the most recent commit message is “WIP”, you’ll know that you were probably in the middle of something. If you push a “WIP” commit, on purpose or by mistake, it signals to other people that more commits might be coming.  

Your history now looks like this:  

```{bash history, eval=FALSE}
A -- B -- C -- WIP*
```

**Don’t push!** The `*` above signifies a commit that exists only in your local repo, not (yet) on GitHub.  

Do a bit more work. Re-check that your project is still in a functional state. Commit again but this time **amend** your previous commit. RStudio offers a check box for “Amend previous commit” or in the shell:  

```{bash amend, eval=FALSE}
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

The `--no-edit` part retains the current commit message of “WIP”.  

**Don’t push!** Your history now looks like this:  

```{bash history_2, eval=FALSE}
A -- B -- C -- WIP*
```

but the changes associated with the WIP* commit now represent your last two commits, i.e. all the accumulated changes since state C.   

Keep going like this.   

Let’s say you’ve finally achieved your goal. One last time, check that your project is functional and in a state you’re willing to share with others.  

Commit, amending again, but with a real commit message this time. Think of this as commit D. Push. Do this in RStudio or the shell:  

```{bash}
git commit --amend -m "Implement awesome feature; closes #43"
git push
```

Your history – and that on GitHub – look like this:

```{bash}
A -- B -- C -- D
```

As far as the world knows, you implemented the feature in one fell swoop. But you got to work on the task incrementally, with the peace of mind that you could never truly break things.
